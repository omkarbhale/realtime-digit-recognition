# Realtime Digit Recognition

Show probabilities from pretrained neural network model in realtime as the user draws


## Architecture

- Actual predictions are performed in python
- Server is written in nodejs
- The server spawns the python script and uses stdin/stdout
- Frontend is served along with an API endpoint for prediction
